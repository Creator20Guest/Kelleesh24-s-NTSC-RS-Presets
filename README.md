# Kelleesh24-s-NTSC-RS-Presets
Just a collection of presets for NTSC-RS I made

And only for NTSC-RS: https://github.com/valadaptive/ntsc-rs

# Usage
To use these presets, you must to drag the .JSON files in C:\User\(PC Name)\AppData\Roaming\ntsc-rs\data\presets (Not to drag a full folder, because the program doesn't open folders :/)

After doing it, if the program is open, press the "Reload" button in the presets section

And done!

# Credits
To none, just to jakediditagain (from YT) to inspire me to make "HD Television" and "LQ Television" presets

And you. Hope you like :/
